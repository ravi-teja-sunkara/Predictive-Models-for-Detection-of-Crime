# Predictive-Models-for-Detection-of-Crime
Applying machine learning to solve handwriting comparison task in forensics.

**University at Buffalo - CSE574: Introduction to Machine Learning**
<p>Project 2</p>

### Implementation and Results
* Developed a solution to find similarity between the handwritten samples of the known and the questioned writer by using: 
a) Linear regression model with threshold classification
b) Logistic regression
c) Deep neural network with Keras and Tensorflow
* Compared model performances on datasets with features extracted by ‘Humans’ and ‘Gradient 
Structural Concavity (GSC) algorithm’.
* Achieved a classification rate of 57% on unseen data of Human observed dataset using neural 
networks. 
* Achieved a classification rate of 76% on unseen data of GSC dataset using neural networks. 
* Modeled the structure, hyperparameters and link weights of the neural network using Keras and 
Tensorflow.
* Trained the regression model and tuned hyper parameters using mini-batch stochastic gradient 
descent method to determine the appropriate weights and normalization factor.

### Software Used
Python, Keras
